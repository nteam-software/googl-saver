## 🗿 Goo.gl Saver 

Google has announced that, in August 2025, all existing goo.gl links (Google URL Shortener) will redirect to a 404 error page.
We don't want that to happen.

Goo.gl Saver is a program that can run on any computer and sends all the goo.gl links it finds on the internet to our server. By letting Goo.gl Saver run on your PC, you help us create a gigantic database and preserve internet integrity.
